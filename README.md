This code was developed for the thesis entitled: "A contribution to the dynamics of epilepsy: identification and control for seizure attenuation" and then published in Neuroinformatics:

Brogin JAF, Faber J, Bueno DD. Estimating the Parameters of the Epileptor Model for Epileptic Seizure Suppression. Neuroinformatics. 2022 Oct;20(4):919-941. doi: 10.1007/s12021-022-09583-6. Epub 2022 Mar 18. PMID: 35303252.

Essentially, the code was developed on the Spyder platform and it consists of applying successive optimizations to time windows of a simulated Epileptor to estimate the parameters of the model that best describe it in that particular window using the Nelder-Mead algorithm.
